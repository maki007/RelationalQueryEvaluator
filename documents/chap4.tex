\chapter{Implementation}

In this chapter we describe implementation details in developed software and describe it's functionality on examples. We will use following example to show optimizations and compiling:


\begin{verbatim}
select
    l_orderkey,
    sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) as revenue,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority
from
    customer,
    orders,
    lineitem
where
    c_mktsegment = '[SEGMENT]'
    and c_custkey = o_custkey
    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    and o_orderdate < date '[DATE]'
    and l_shipdate > date '[DATE]'
group by
    l_orderkey,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority
order by
    revenue desc,
    o_orderdate;
\end{verbatim}

This example is taken from Tpc benchmark \cite{benchmark}. $[DATE]$ and $[SEGMENT]$ are constants. In this benchmark there are no indexes on tables.
